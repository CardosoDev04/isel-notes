JPA or Jakarta Persistence API  is a Java API that serves as an [[ORM]] to facilitate the interaction between Java code and the data layer (DBMS).

As any other [[ORM]], JPA includes support for:
- [[Class (DB Entity) Representation]]
- [[Entity Management]]

It is through the use of JPA that a programmer is able to interact with the DBMS, and develop high-level business logic that abstracts from pure SQL.


In the context of this course, we've used JPA to implement and application that follows [[Enterprise Design Patterns]].
