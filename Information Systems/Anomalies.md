An anomaly refers to the violation of [[ACID]] properties by conflicting transactions.

There are many types of anomalies, but the one's we've studied are:

- [[Dirty Read]]
- [[Non-repeatable Read]]
- [[Phantoms]]

These anomalies are usually resolved by a mechanism in DBMS called [[Isolation Level]].
