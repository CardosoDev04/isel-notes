Variables in PSM are the same as variables in any other programming language. They are mainly ways to store values and to use said values in other parts of the program without having to re-fetch them every single time we wish to do manipulations with them.


They are declared in PLPGSQL in the following way:

```SQL
declare salario int;
```

With keyword declare being use to initialize the declaration of the variable, followed by the variable name / signature and ending with the variable type.

In this case we have a variable called "salario" of type "int" (Integer value).
